# Near-Surface Met + VIC Hydrologic Model Outputs: NCAR 12 km Edition

## Background

The purpose of this effort is to curate the NCAR Alaska Near Surface Meteorology Daily Averages and the Alaska VIC Hydro Model Output (1950-2099) Daily Averages [dataset](https://www.earthsystemgrid.org/dataset/ucar.ral.hydro.predictions.html) for ARDAC and for integration with tools such as Northern Climate Reports and the Arctic-EDS. Source data are available for download from the Climate Data Gateway at NCAR.

## Source Data

### Source Description

To paraphrase the NCAR blurb about this dataset:

<p>
High resolution ensembles of hydroclimate projections are useful for climate and water resources adaptation planning. Very few century-long, high-resolution hydroclimate projections exist over Alaska and none are statewide. This motivated development of a dataset consisting of multiple statistically downscaled climate model projections and corresponding off-line hydrologic model simulations to obtain hydrologic simulations from 1950 to 2099 over Alaska, which fills a critical gap in hydroclimate projection capabilities. Robust warming and increases in precipitation produce runoff increases for most of Alaska. However, runoff is likely to decrease in current glacierized areas in southeast Alaska.
</p>

The following approach was used to construct the source dataset:

1. select climate model outputs based on CMIP5 RCPs 4.5 and 8.5
2. perform statistical downscaling to generate high-resolution (12 km) climate input data for hydrologic models
3. perform off-line hydrologic model simulations, using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. A full water-energy balance computation with a simple glacier model for Alaska is used.

### Source File Structure

The source data are annual netCDF files (with a daily frequency time step) that contain the data for a single model and scenario. There are 10 models and 2 scenarios. Within each model-scenario combination there are files of a few different types:

- The Alaska Near Surface Meteorology Daily Averages have files names like `ACCESS1-3_rcp45_BCSD_met_1958.nc` - the variables within these files are downscaled climate model output (they are not created by the VIC hydrologic model). `met` climate variables include:

  - tmax (Maximum Daily 2-m air temperature, degrees C)
  - tmin (Minimum Daily 2-m air temperature, degrees C)
  - pcp (Daily precipitation, mm per day)

- The VIC hydrologic model outputs have filenames like `MRI-CGCM3_rcp85_BCSD_ws_2094.nc`, `GFDL-ESM2M_rcp85_BCSD_wf_2035.nc` and `CSIRO-Mk3-6-0_rcp85_BCSD_eb_2044.nc` where the tags `wf`, `ws` and `eb` are a shorthand that indicate what types of variables exist within each file set. The scheme is as follows:
  - `ws` (water state)
    - SWE (Snow water equivalent, mm)
    - IWE (Ice water equivalent, mm)
    - SM1 (Soil moisture layer1, mm)
    - SM2 (Soil moisture layer1, mm)
    - SM3 (Soil moisture layer3, mm)
    - WATER_ERROR (water balance error, mm)
  - `wf` (water flux)
    - RUNOFF (surface runoff, mm per day)
    - BASEFLOW (baseflow, mm per day)
    - EVAP (actual evapotranspiration, mm per day)
    - PRCP (precipitation, mm per day)
    - SNOW_MELT (snow melt, mm per day)
    - GLACER_MELT (ice melt, mm per day)
  - `eb` (energy balance)
    - NET_SHORT (net shortwave radiation, W/m<sup>2</sup>)
    - NET_LONG (net longwave radiation, W/m<sup>2</sup>)
    - SENSIBLE (sensible heat flux, W/m<sup>2</sup>)
    - LATENT (latent heat flux, W/m<sup>2</sup>)
    - GRND_FLUX (ground heat flux, W/m<sup>2</sup>)
    - SOIL_TEMP1 (soil temperature layer 1, degrees C)
    - SOIL_TEMP2 (soil temperature layer 2, degrees C)
    - SOIL_TEMP3 (soil temperature layer 3, degrees C)
    - ENERGY_ERROR (energy balance error, W/m<sup>2</sup>)

Note that our initial scope of work for this dataset does not include the energy balance (`eb`) portion of the VIC model outputs.

## Processing Flow

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook sets the stage for our expectations about the data and is used to craft some assertions to check for mistakes during processing. The `config.py` module establishes some directory structures, and lists the models and scenarios, and asserts which variables will be processed and how, and provides the template for output filenames. The module `compute_summaries.py` contains the functions and logic used to create decadal averages of monthly summaries (means, totals, or maximum values) of the various climate variables listed above. Input sets of NetCDF files are processed with this module and summary GeoTIFF files are created on a model / scenario / variable / month / decade basis. Notebooks orchestrate the processing of each variable group (`wf`, `ws`, or `met`) using a Dask local cluster. The processing of each variable group is done within a notebook specific for that variable group, but the core logic and configuration is shared across notebooks. The `reproject` notebook illustrates a few different pathways for reprojecting the data to EPSG:3338 but ultimately uses rasterio and dask to accomplish the task. Finally, there is a quality control (`qc`) notebook and some stuff (a notebook and a shell script) to orchestrate zipping the data up on a per-variable basis.

## Usage

Use the `snap-geo` conda environment on an Atlas compute node for this work. You'll need to set the following environment variables: `DATA_DIR` and `OUTPUT_DIR` - these are the directories for the source and output datasets. Set these:

```sh
export DATA_DIR=path_to_source_dataset
export OUTPUT_DIR=path_to_write_outputs
```

or they will default to some directories in cparr4's scratch space (see `config.py`).

If you only want to process certain models, scenarios, months, or variables, you can edit `config.py` to reduce the scope of processing as well.

Also note that if you want to monitor the Dask client it defaults to port 8787 (http://127.0.0.1:8787/status) so you'll need to forward that port as well.
